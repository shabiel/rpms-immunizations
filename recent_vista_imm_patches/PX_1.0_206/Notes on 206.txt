PX*1*206 requires the XU and HDI patch. 
 
The post install will not run if DUZ("AG") does not equal "V".

The post install: 

1. Converts the SKIN TEST file (9999999.28).  It should result in 8 entries with a CLASS of NATIONAL.
2. Calls an STS API to standardize 9 VIMM files.   This will NOT occur in a non-VA account since it requires connectivity to FORUM and to VIE.
