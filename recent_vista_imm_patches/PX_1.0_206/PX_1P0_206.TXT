Description:
===========
 
The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
(VistA) Immunizations Enhancements (VIMM) 2.0 project modifies existing
Skin Test files and adds additional files to enable VA to quickly and
reliably document and exchange standardized skin test and immunization
information on beneficiaries across services and departments.
Additionally, modifications support VistA Evolution requirements. This
provides a Veteran patient-centric vaccine record exchangeable with the
external community. Clinicians will have access to a more complete medical
history in the VistA electronic medical record resulting in improved
health status as well as public health monitoring.
 
The goals for the VIMM 2.0 project are to deliver an Initial Operating
Capability comprised of standard, interoperable skin test and immunization
data for exchange with external trading partners based on the
modernization of the VistA Patient Care Encounter (PCE) package.
 
This patch provides the following new features:
 
1) The Skin Test records in the SKIN TEST (#9999999.28) file are 
standardized to use consistent nomenclature for all VA facilities.
 
   During the post installation, records in the SKIN TEST file are
   modified and new Skin Test records are added to mirror entries from 
   a nationally standardized table.   
 
   A new field (CLASS) has been added to identify each record as NATIONAL
   or LOCAL. Only records with a CLASS of NATIONAL are selectable.   
   If a record is not the standard, the CLASS will be set to LOCAL and 
   the INACTIVE FLAG will be set to INACTIVE.
 
2) The options, PXTT EDIT SKIN TEST and PXTT IN/ACTIVATE SKIN TEST, 
have been placed out of order. Future updates to the SKIN TEST file
will be maintained by the Master File Server.
 
3) Bar codes from the Vaccine Information Statement Lookup table     
(http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/code-sets/vis-barcode-lookup-t ab
le.html) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been
added to the VACCINE INFORMATION STATEMENT file (#920) to support use of
scanning technology when recording which Vaccine Information Statement has
been provided to a patient. The patch will also populate the Veterans 
Health Administration Unique Identifiers (VUIDs) for this file.
 
4) A spelling error in the short name for the IMMUNIZATION record,
VARICELLA, is corrected from VARCELLA to VARICELLA.
 
5) This patch populates VUID data fields for the following files:
   #920        VACCINE INFORMATION STATEMENT
   #920.1      IMMUNIZATION INFO SOURCE
   #920.2      IMM ADMINISTRATION ROUTE
   #920.3      IMM ADMINISTRATION SITE (BODY)
   #920.4      IMM CONTRAINDICATIONS
   #920.5      IMM REFUSALS
   #9999999.04 IMM MANUFACTURER
   #9999999.14 IMMUNIZATION
   #9999999.28 SKIN TEST
 
6) The SKIN TEST file (#9999999.28) includes two new fields that are 
Indian Health Service (IHS) fields and are added for backward 
compatibility. These two fields are CODE (#.02) and CPT CODE (#.11).
 
7)  Values in the MAX # IN SERIES field (#.05) in the IMMUNIZATION file 
(#9999999.14) are standardized to be uniform across all VA facilities.  
MAX # IN SERIES defines the permissible values for the SERIES property 
when documenting an immunization in the V IMMUNIZATION file 
(#9000010.11). Existing values at VA facilities will be replaced by the 
standardized values, including removal of data where the standard does 
not have a MAX # IN SERIES value.

Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
------------------------------------- 
Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
patch is available.
 
The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/.
This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may 
also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as follows:
 
 Albany         ftp.ftpserver.domain.ext <ftp://ftp.ftpserver.domain.ext>
 Hines          ftp.ftpserve.domain.ext  <ftp://ftp.ftpserve.domain.ext>
 Salt Lake City ftp.ftpsrv.domain.ext     <ftp://ftp.ftpsrv.domain.ext>

Patch Installation:
 
Pre/Post Installation Overview:
-------------------------------
This patch will run a brief pre-installation process that will check for
duplicate entries in the SKIN TEST file (#9999999.28). If any duplicates
are detected, the installation will abort. Use the option, PXTT EDIT 
SKIN TESTS, to rename duplicates and restart the installation of
the patch.
 
A post-installation process will standardize data in the SKIN TEST file
(#9999999.28). Any errors that occur are displayed and an email with
more
detail is sent to the installer.
 
If no errors occur during the conversion of the SKIN TEST file, a HEALTH
DATA INFORMATICS (HDI) routine is called to populate VUID data from the
FORUM Master File Server.
 
The post installation routine calls an HDI routine to request the      
VUID data for the following files:
   #920.1      IMMUNIZATION INFO SOURCE
   #920.2      IMM ADMINISTRATION ROUTE
   #920.3      IMM ADMINISTRATION SITE (BODY)
   #920.4      IMM CONTRAINDICATIONS
   #920.5      IMM REFUSALS
   #9999999.04 IMM MANUFACTURER
   #9999999.14 IMMUNIZATION
   #9999999.28 SKIN TEST
 
The routine, PXVP206, may be deleted after the patch is successfully
installed.

   c.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
