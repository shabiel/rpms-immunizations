The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
"BLD",9189,1,2,0)
(VistA) Immunizations Enhancements (VIMM) 2.0 project modifies existing
"BLD",9189,1,3,0)
Skin Test files and adds additional files to enable VA to quickly and
"BLD",9189,1,4,0)
reliably document and exchange standardized skin test and immunization
"BLD",9189,1,5,0)
information on beneficiaries across services and departments.
"BLD",9189,1,6,0)
Additionally, modifications support VistA Evolution requirements. This
"BLD",9189,1,7,0)
provides a Veteran patient-centric vaccine record exchangeable with the
"BLD",9189,1,8,0)
external community. Clinicians will have access to a more complete medical
"BLD",9189,1,9,0)
history in the VistA electronic medical record resulting in improved
"BLD",9189,1,10,0)
health status as well as public health monitoring.

"BLD",9189,1,12,0)
The goals for the VIMM 2.0 project are to deliver an Initial Operating
"BLD",9189,1,13,0)
Capability comprised of standard, interoperable skin test and immunization
"BLD",9189,1,14,0)
data for exchange with external trading partners based on the
"BLD",9189,1,15,0)
modernization of the VistA Patient Care Encounter (PCE) package.
