Description:
============

 The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) Immunizations Enhancements (VIMM) 2.0 project, Increment 2, 
 builds upon the file structures and standardized data introduced by 
 Increment 1 by adding functional enhancements to the existing VistA 
 Patient Care Encounter (PCE) package.
  
 This patch provides the following new features:
  
 1) A new Clinical Reminders index will be created on the V Immunization 
    file (#9000010.11). This additional index uses the immunization's CVX 
    code. The indexes are stored in the Clinical Reminders index global as:
      ^PXRMINDX(9000010.11,"CVX","IP",CVX CODE,DFN,DATE,DAS)
      ^PXRMINDX(9000010.11,"CVX","PI",DFN,CVX CODE,DATE,DAS)
    Also, the Clinical Reminders indexes on the V Immunization will be 
    changed to use the Event Date and Time field (#1201) (if populated) as 
    the DATE instead of the Visit Date and Time. The Visit Date and Time 
    will be used as DATE only if the Event Date and Time is not populated.
  
 2) The following Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have been added
    or modified:
    a) DATA2PCE^PXAPI (Modified) - Support for the following immunization 
       fields have been added to the INPUTROOT array parameter: VIS 
       Offered/Given To Patient, Remarks, and Ordering Provider
    b) ENCEVENT^PXKENC and GETENC^PXAPI (Modified) - The following V 
       Immunization fields have been added to the returned ^TMP global 
       array: VIS Offered/Given To Patient, Remarks, and Other Diagnosis
    c) VIS^PXAPI (New) - Returns a Vaccine Information Statement entry
  
 3) The PX SAVE DATA remote procedure call (RPC) has been modified to 
    provide support for CVX Code, Event Info Source IEN, Route IEN and HL7 
    Code, Admin Site IEN and HL7 code, Lot # IEN, Event Date/Time, 
    Ordering Provider, VIS, and Remarks.
  
 4) The security codes on the Immunization (9999999.14) and Skin Test 
    (9999999.28) files will be updated as follows: AUDIT="@", DD="@", 
    DEL="@", LAYGO="@", RD="", and WR="@".
  
 5) The PCE skin test documentation process is updated to include the 
    following:
    a) Test placement, reading and interpretation
    b) Code set mapping
    c) Diagnosis information entry and updates are restricted to users 
       with supervisor access.
    
 6) The PCE immunization documentation process is updated to include the 
    following:
    a) Lot number, ordering provider, dosage, route of administration, site
       of administration
    b) Post-administration reading and interpretation for immunizations 
       that require reading, such as smallpox.
    c) Diagnosis information entry and updates are restricted to users 
       with supervisor access.
    
 7) Immunization inventory management functionality is added by this patch.
    This functionality includes allowing authorized users to enter and 
    update information in the IMMUNIZATION LOT file (#9999999.41). This 
    functionality provides for displaying available immunization 
    inventory. Cross reference functionality decrements the number of doses
    unused when an immunization lot is assigned to a patient's immunization
    record.
  
 8) Values for the following fields in the V SKIN TEST file (#9000010.12) 
    are moved from existing fields to new fields by a post-install process.
    The old fields and their data are removed from the file after moving
    the data.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 The pre-installation process removes seven MUMPS cross-references that 
 existed only in early versions of this patch.
  
 The post-installation process does the following:
 a) Tasks a job to rebuild the Clinical Reminder's V Immunization index.
    When installing the patch, the user will be prompted when this task
    should be queued (see installation instructions below). This should be
    queued to run during non-peak hours. It is very important that it is
    done during non-peak hours, as while the rebuild is taking place all
    evaluation, dialogs, reminder order checks, and anything using reminder
    evaluation will be suspended. When the index is completed building, an
    email gets sent to the user who installed the patch and to the mail
    group specified in the REMINDER MANAGEMENT MAILGROUP field (#3) of the
    CLINICAL REMINDER PARAMETERS file (#800).
  
 b) Moves diagnosis values from the existing diagnosis fields in the V SKIN
    TEST file (#9000010.12) to the new diagnosis fields, deletes the values
    in the existing fields and finally deletes the existing fields from the
    data dictionary as described above in the new features section.
  
 c) Tasks a process to split the V IMMUNIZATION dosage values stored in the
    existing DOSAGE field (#1312) into DOSE (#1312) and DOSE UNITS (#1313).
    If the existing value does not match the DD, it will be appended to the
    COMMENTS field (#81101).
  
 The routine PXVP210 may be deleted after the email is received that the
 index was rebuilt.

       other changes such as DD's or templates. 
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will allow
       you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
       installed. It compares all components of this patch (routines,
       DD's, templates, etc.). 
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you to
       ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
       global.

    index: ' Enter a queue date/time for rebuilding the Clinical Reminders
    index on the V immunization file. It should be queued to run during 
    non-peak hours. The date/time entered must fall within 7 days of the 
    patch installation date and will be queued to run at the end of patch 
    installation if a value is not entered. (See pre/post installation 
    overview above).
  
 7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',
    respond NO.
  
 8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
 1. When the index is completed building, an email gets sent to the user
    who installed the patch and to the mail group specified in the REMINDER
    MANAGEMENT MAILGROUP field (#3) of the CLINICAL REMINDER PARAMETERS 
    file (#800). The routine PXVP210 may be deleted after the email is
    received that the index was rebuilt.
  
 2. Users authorized to manage immunization inventory should be assigned
    the PXV IMM INVENTORY MGR security key.
  
 3. The option PXVTASK-NIGHT should be tasked to run daily at 12:01 AM.
