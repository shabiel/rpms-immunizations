The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
"BLD",9071,1,2,0)
(VistA) Immunizations Enhancements (VIMM) 1.0 project modifies existing
"BLD",9071,1,3,0)
immunization files and adds additional files to enable VA to quickly and
"BLD",9071,1,4,0)
reliably document and exchange standardized immunization information on
"BLD",9071,1,5,0)
beneficiaries across services and departments. Additionally, modifications
"BLD",9071,1,6,0)
support Certification for Meaningful Use as well as VistA Evolution
"BLD",9071,1,7,0)
requirements. This provides a Veteran patient-centric vaccine record
"BLD",9071,1,8,0)
exchangeable with the external community. Clinicians will have access to a
"BLD",9071,1,9,0)
more complete medical history in the VistA electronic medical record
"BLD",9071,1,10,0)
resulting in improved health status as well as public health monitoring.

The goals for the VIMM 1.0 project are to deliver an Initial Operating
"BLD",9071,1,13,0)
Capability comprised of standard, interoperable immunization data for
"BLD",9071,1,14,0)
exchange with external trading partners based on the modernization of
"BLD",9071,1,15,0)
the VistA Patient Care Encounter (PCE) package.

In the VA, if a CPT code is entered into PCE that represents an

immunization, than an immunization will automatically be entered in the V

Immunization file.  And vice versa, if an immunization is entered into PCE
"^DIC",9000010.11,9000010.11,"%D",17,0)
that has a related CPT code, then a V CPT entry will automatically be
"^DIC",9000010.11,9000010.11,"%D",18,0)
created with the CPT code for the immunization.  The PCE Code Mapping file
