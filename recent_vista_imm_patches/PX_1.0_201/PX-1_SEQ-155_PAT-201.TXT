Description:
============

  
 **********************************************************************
 NOTE:  This patch contains updates to the Data Dictionary for several 
 files that are also used by Indian Health Service.  In order to 
 maintain compatibility with the Indian Health Service version of these 
 files, fields used by Indian Health Service that will not be used by 
 the Department of Veterans Affairs have been included.  In some cases, 
 these fields reference files and/or routines that will not be deployed 
 by the Department of Veterans Affairs.  These fields are included with 
 the VA's Database Administrator's approval.
 **********************************************************************
  
 The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) Immunizations Enhancements (VIMM) 1.0 project modifies existing
 immunization files and adds additional files to enable VA to quickly and
 reliably document and exchange standardized immunization information on
 beneficiaries across services and departments. Additionally, modifications
 support Certification for Meaningful Use as well as VistA Evolution
 requirements. This provides a Veteran patient-centric vaccine record
 exchangeable with the external community. Clinicians will have access to a
 more complete medical history in the VistA electronic medical record
 resulting in improved health status as well as public health monitoring.
  
 The goals for the VIMM 1.0 project are to deliver an Initial Operating
 Capability comprised of standard, interoperable immunization data for
 exchange with external trading partners based on the modernization of
 the VistA Patient Care Encounter (PCE) package.
  
 This patch provides the following new features:
  
 1) The vaccines in the IMMUNIZATION (#9999999.14) file are standardized to
    match the Center for Disease Control (CDC)'s table of administered
    vaccines at 
    http://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=cvx. 
  
    During the post installation, records in the IMMUNIZATION file are
    modified and new immunization records are added to mirror entries 
    from the CDC table. Existing records are assigned a Vaccine
    Administered (CVX) code. CVX codes are developed and maintained by the
    CDC. They identify the type of vaccine product used.
  
    A new field (CLASS) has been added to identify each record as NATIONAL
    or LOCAL. Only records with a CLASS of NATIONAL are selectable. The
    NAME and INACTIVE FLAG of NATIONAL records will be updated to match the
    CDC Standard. Other CDC information has been added to the record for
    future use.
  
    There may be more than one record with the same CVX code. A record is 
    selected as the standard based on the following selection rules:
    o An entry that does not have the INACTIVE FLAG marked will be given 
      precedence over an entry that is marked INACTIVE.
    o An entry that was distributed nationally with the immunization
      package will be given precedence over an entry that was created
      locally.
    o An entry that was created in the VistA instance where this patch
      is being installed will be given precedence over an entry imported
      from another VAMC. 
    o ACTION/RECOMMENDATION: In order to guide the program to selecting a
      facility's choice on which of two conflicting entries for the same
      CVX code will be marked as NATIONAL, for any entries in the
      IMMUNIZATION file that represent the same concept, mark all except
      one of them as INACTIVE.
  
    If a record is not the standard, the CLASS will be set to LOCAL and 
    (HISTORICAL) will be appended to the name. The INACTIVE FLAG will be
    set to INACTIVE.
  
 2) Data stored in the DIAGNOSIS (#.08) field in the V IMMUNIZATION 
    (#9000010.11) file are moved to a new field, PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS (#1304).
    This field is blank in most records. Values stored in DIAGNOSIS 2
    (#.09), DIAGNOSIS 3 (#.1), DIAGNOSIS 4 (#.11), DIAGNOSIS 5 (#.12),
    DIAGNOSIS 6 (#.13), DIAGNOSIS 7 (#.14) and DIAGNOSIS 8 (#.15) are moved
    to the multiple OTHER DIAGNOSES (#3).
  
 3) The options, PXTT EDIT IMMUNIZATIONS and PXTT IN/ACTIVATE IMMUNIZATION 
    have been placed out of order. Future updates to the IMMUNIZATION file
    will be provided in the short term by patches. In the long term the
    IMMUNIZATION file will be maintained by the Master File Server.
  
 4) Indian Health Service (IHS) fields have been included in the files for 
    this patch for purposes of code convergence, even though the VA does
    not use them. Of those fields, the following point to files or call
    routines that are included in the IHS Resource and Patient Management
    System (RPMS) but not in VistA:

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ------------------------------------- 
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
 patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
 ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as 
 follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.domain.ext  <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Hines          ftp.domain.ext   <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Salt Lake City ftp.domain.ext     <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library 
 at:

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 This patch will run a brief pre-installation process that will check for 
 invalid entries in the IMMUNIZATION file (#9999999.14) and will delete 
 field definitions for replaced fields in the V IMMUNIZATION file 
 (#9000010.11). A post-installation process will standardize data in the 
 IMMUNIZATION file (#9999999.14) and will move data from exiting diagnosis 
 fields in the V IMMUNIZATION file (#9000010.11) to new fields. The 
 routine, PXVP201, may be deleted after the patch is successfully
 installed.

 1. Load the KIDS distribution file via the 'Load a Distribution' option 
    on the KIDS Installation menu.
  
 2. Prior to installing the patch use the following installation options 
    located on the KIDS Installation menu:

        you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
        transport global.
  
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
        is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
        (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
  
    c.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
        backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
 3. Install the KIDS distribution via the 'Install Package(s)' option on 
    the KIDS Installation menu. For the Install Name enter PX*1.0*201.
  
    a.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
        Install? NO//'
        Answer NO.
  
    b.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//
        Answer NO.
  
    c.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? NO//'
        Answer NO. 
  
 4.  Verify the status of the installation.  An email message is sent to 
     the installer at the end of the installation indicating whether the
     installation was successful. Please enter a Remedy ticket if the 
     installation failed.
