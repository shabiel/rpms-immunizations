     This screen displays all users who hold any of the four  Keys to
     the Immunization Package.  The Keys, which begin with BIZ, are 
     listed as column headers at the top of the screen.
 
     A "YES" in the column under a Key name indicates that the user
     listed on that line holds the Key in the column header.
 
     There are four Keys included in the Immunization Package:
     
     
     1 - BIZMENU
     -----------
     Gives Users access to the Main Menu of the Immunization Package,
     with minimal permission to view Patients' Immunization data, to print
     Official Immunization Records, to view/print Due Lists, and to run
     reports.
     
     
     2 - BIZ EDIT PATIENTS
     ---------------------
     Gives Users the ability to ADD/EDIT Patients' immunization data,
     contraindications, skin tests, and other patient information.  This
     Key functions by making various Add/Edit Actions available on the
     main Patient View screen of the Patient Immunization Record Option.
     
     (Users without this key will still be able to view patient data
     from the Patient Immunization Record Option, but they will only be
     able to view the Immunization data and the Health Summary, and print
     the Official Immunization Record.)
     
     
     3 - BIZ MANAGER
     ---------------
     Gives Users access to the Manager Menu of the New Immunization
     Package and the full range of Manager functions, such as, editing
     Case Managers, editing Form Letters, editing Site Parameters, etc.
     Since you are here, you have the BIZ MANAGER Key described above and are 
     allowed to allocate or de-allocate any of the Immunization (BIZ) Keys to 
     other Users.
 
 
     4 - BIZ LOT ONLY
     ----------------
     This "stand-alone" option is NOT connected to the rest of the RPMS 
     Immunization Menu; instead it may be assigned to any menu of any user
     for the purpose of adding and editing Lot Numbers in the Immunization
     Package. The option allows someone, such as a pharmacist, to add and
     maintain the Lot Number Inventory without gaining access to the rest
     of the Manager Menu in the Immunization Package.
     
     There are two Actions presented at the bottom of the screen:
      
        1 - "Add/Edit a Holder" allows you to allocate or deallocate the
            Immunization Keys to users.
        
        2 - "Help" (this screen) presents a detailed explanation of the
            privileges each Key bestows upon holders of the Key.
 
 
     NOTE: If you intend to allocate Keys to a large number of Users,
           it may be more convenient to have your Site Manager to this
           in batch mode under the Site Manager's Key Management Menu.
