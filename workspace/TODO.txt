This is a list of items which I thought were too hard for me to do or I would
rather not spend any more time doing them.

1. Getting smoking status for VISTA
   (need to do create a reminder based on an unreleased patch and ship that
   ... too hard!!!)
2. Recording the NDC for a lot number in VISTA.
   (need to modify form BI LOT to create a new field that backs the VISTA
    new field and then unload that in a BI variable).
3. BILOT expiration date sort doesn't work.
4. BILOT help doesn't work (need to port over help text to dialog file).
5. I disabled the "error" that the forecaster isn't working (it isn't a
   software error); but it doesn't say anything in the listman form. It needs
   to say "forecaster disabled" in the imms due section.

   ERR    Edit Patient Errors  <-- Don't know how this works.
   CMG    Add/Edit Case Manager <-- Done
   CMT    Transfer a Case Manager's Patients <-- Maybe it works? Don't know.
   SCN    Scan For Patients <-- Need more patients to do that.

Skipped:

ON CI: LM add/edit screen; column short for VISTA.
On Patient main form: Says no BDP package. Use PCMM. However, for now, hide this.
On Patient main form: Immunizations due list doesn't print what's due:
  When forecasting, the forecast sometimes does not show up in the Patient Form
  because it relies on Vaccine Groups, and Vaccine Groups are not populated in the
  file in VISTA.
  
  To fix this: Series type not found (= OTHER), change FORECASTING to ON.
  
  VACCINE GROUP (SERIES TYPE): OTHER      DISPLAY ORDER: 90
  SHORT NAME: OTHER                     FORECASTING ON/OFF: ON
  AVAILABLE ON FORECASTNG MENU: NO      INCLUDE IN TWO-YR-OLD REPORT: NO

TODO:
Next work on Patient Enter/Edit Imm.
--> Add VISTA fields to it.
--> See PXVVISIT for all the details.

In VISTA, prevent the editing of the actual immunization. Only allow deletion. But all other fields are okay to edit.
In VISTA, Admin Date should be Admin Date/Time.
