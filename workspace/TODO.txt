This is a list of items which I thought were too hard for me to do or I would
rather not spend any more time doing them.

1. Getting smoking status for VISTA
   (need to do create a reminder based on an unreleased patch and ship that
   ... too hard!!!)
2. Recording the NDC for a lot number in VISTA.
   (need to modify form BI LOT to create a new field that backs the VISTA
    new field and then unload that in a BI variable).
3. BILOT expiration date sort doesn't work.
4. BILOT help doesn't work (need to port over help text to dialog file).
5. I disabled the "error" that the forecaster isn't working (it isn't a
   software error); but it doesn't say anything in the listman form. It needs
   to say "forecaster disabled" in the imms due section.
6. None of the errors (BIERR) have been ported over. All error entries need to
   go in the 920 x 10000 numberspace in the Dialog file and invoked using the
   ^DIALOG API.

Rest of MGR Menu:

Next: Eligibility Table edit --> skip for now.
Export Imm --> Later. Can't do or test now.

   ERR    Edit Patient Errors  <-- Don't know how this works.
   CMG    Add/Edit Case Manager <-- Done
   CMT    Transfer a Case Manager's Patients <-- Maybe it works? Don't know.
   SCN    Scan For Patients <-- Need more patients to do that.
 ------
 
Next work on Patient Enter/Edit Imm.
--> Get LM form working
--> Get Screen Form working
--> Add VISTA fields to it.
--> Create a filer for VISTA

WORKING ON CI:
next thing: get LM delete working.
check that filing is correct (there are many elements to that)
(duplicate files now when editing).
Port files and forms to RPMS
