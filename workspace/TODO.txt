This is a list of items which I thought were too hard for me to do or I would
rather not spend any more time doing them.

1. Getting smoking status for VISTA
   (need to do create a reminder based on an unreleased patch and ship that
   ... too hard!!!)
2. Recording the NDC for a lot number in VISTA.
   (need to modify form BI LOT to create a new field that backs the VISTA
    new field and then unload that in a BI variable).
3. BILOT expiration date sort doesn't work.
4. BILOT help doesn't work (need to port over help text to dialog file).
