This is a list of items which I thought were too hard for me to do or I would
rather not spend any more time doing them.

1. Getting smoking status for VISTA
   (need to do create a reminder based on an unreleased patch and ship that
   ... too hard!!!)
2. Recording the NDC for a lot number in VISTA.
   (need to modify form BI LOT to create a new field that backs the VISTA
    new field and then unload that in a BI variable).
3. BILOT expiration date sort doesn't work.
4. BILOT help doesn't work (need to port over help text to dialog file).

Rest of MGR Menu:

Next: Eligibility Table edit --> skip for now.
Export Imm --> Later. Can't do or test now.

   ERR    Edit Patient Errors  <-- Don't know how this works.
   CMG    Add/Edit Case Manager <-- Done
   CMT    Transfer a Case Manager's Patients <-- Maybe it works? Don't know.
   SCN    Scan For Patients <-- Need more patients to do that.

Next work on Patient Enter/Edit Imm.
