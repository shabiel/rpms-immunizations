# RPMS Immunizations
Created by Sam Habiel, who now needs more money. Hopefully the rich wife will
be coming soon.

This is a poor man's port of RPMS Immunizations to VISTA. Explicit dependencies
on PCC + Taxonomies have been removed; and the software now is installable
on VISTA but not not quite functional. You can see the menus and administer
the inventory but not give a patient an immunization. This is a great starting
point for comparing this against VISTA's VIMM project.

## Installation
