## Overall description of the project
In my (Sam Habiel) opinion, the RPMS Immunization package is the crown jewel of
RPMS, providing amazing patient care capabilities and population health
analytics. By its nature, immunizations don't work unless most of the
population is immunized.

The project exists as a showcase of code convergence: running the same package
on RPMS and VISTA. This has been by and large achieved.
